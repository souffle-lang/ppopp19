Description: Translator of declarative Datalog programs into the C++ language.
 Soufflé is a translator of declarative Datalog programs into the C++ language.
 Soufflé is used as a domain-specific language for static program analysis, over
 large code bases with millions of lines of code. Soufflé aims to produce
 high-performance C++ code that can be compiled with the native compiler on
 the target machine.
